        <p>I am from San Diego, CA!
        <br>I am majoring in Innovation, Society, and Technology in the iSchool.
        <br>In my free time, I enjoy napping, watching Netflix, and exploring Syracuse with my friends.
        <br>Two of my main goals during my time here at Syracuse are to find good food spots (dining hall food is horrible) and to engage in the community!</p>
